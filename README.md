# EventsRDF

A project implemented for the Web Based Systems course at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje.

The project consists of crawling events from few web sites, storing them as a RDF model to a .ttl file and then serving them to the client.

The [client](https://github.com/cvetanov/EventsClient) is a simple Redux application that only consumes the data served from the controller.
